    <h1> Vanilla+ Mods </h1>
    <p> These are light, simple, and minimal mods that add content which accompany normal Minecraft gameplay.
        They aim to complement Vanilla Minecraft and don't add anything too drastic, and some are just for quality of life.
        <span style="font-weight: bold;">REMEMBER:</span> Mods with a <span style="color: green;">green title</span> means that it's approved (as in, the majority agreed to add it to the server)
        and the ones with <span style="color: red;">red titles</span> are still pending/undecided.

    <h2 class="undecided">Simple Voice Chat</h3>
    <div> Available on: All Loaders</div>
    <p> Mod to give us voice chat inside Minecraft.
        You have to press V in-game to configure your settings (your mic, volume, etc) and it's proximity by default.
        Proximity is basically the volume of someone's voice would be lower the farther they are from you.
        To talk to someone even though they're very very far away,
        you can also make a group voice inside the mod to hear someone in the same volume no matter where they are in the world.
        Don't wanna talk? You can mute too!</p>

    <h2 class="undecided">Supplementaries</h3>
    <div> Available on: NeoForge, Fabric</div>
    <p> This mod is the most Vanilla-esque in this entire list.
        It adds content that could very well be in the main game and complements Vanilla Minecraft.
        It adds features like useful decorations and functional blocks.
        You can see some of these in the gif thumbnail above.</p>

    <h2 class="undecided">Farmer's Delight</h3>
    <div> Available on: NeoForge, Forge</div>
    <p> My absolute favorite mod that expands on Minecraft's farming and cooking.
        It adds crops, foods, and cooking objects.
        Still in the style of Vanilla. I love farming. (in games, i would not survive in real life)</p>

    <p> A must have addition to this mod is Cultural Delights, an add-on that lets you cook real world food around the world.</p>

    <h2 class="undecided">RightClickHarvest</h3>
    <div> Available on: NeoForge, Fabric</div>
    <p> Simple quality of life mod that lets you right click a crop with a hoe to harvest it and replant the seed instantly.
      You also now get XP from harvesting.</p>

    <h2 class="undecided">Artifacts</h3>
    <div> Available on: NeoForge, Fabric</div>
    <p> A cosmetic mod that adds various Vanilla-style rare accesories and items which you can find from chests in all structures.
        It encourages exploration because these items have slight but useful bonuses when you wear them.
        That thumbnail is an A, not an Among Us character.</p>

    <h2 class="undecided">Another Furniture</h3>
    <div> Available on: NeoForge, Fabric</div>
    <p> This is the most Vanilla-esque furniture mod so far.
        It doesn't have weird, out-of-place stuff like fridges or electric stoves but
        is supposed to be simple Vanilla-style furniture. I REALLY like this mod.</p>

    <h2 class="undecided">Geophilic</h3>
    <div> Available on: All Loaders</div>
    <p> A mod that subtly overhauls the biomes in a simple way without adding any new blocks in the game.
        It adds minor stuff like fallen trees, forest clearings, tree stumps, boulders, etc.
        And most importantly? It slightly RAISES the HEIGHT of leaves so you don't BUMP YOUR HEAD IN EVERY TREE WHILE WALKING THROUGH A FOREST.
        Very nice.</p>
