    <h1> HELLO!!!!!!!!!!!! </h1>
    <p class="nomarginbottom"> This is me Heirone, here I will document the POSSIBLE mods that our minecraft server will be using.
        They will be divided by Vanilla+, Content, and Client mods.
        Mods with a <span style="color: limegreen;">green title</span> means that it's approved (as in, the majority agreed to add it to the server)
        and the ones with <span style="color: red;">red titles</span> are still pending/undecided.
        Most mods are unfortunately not up to date with <span style="font-weight: bold;">1.21.8</span> and this is why our target version for our server is <span style="font-weight: bold;">1.21.1.</span></p>
    <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Feel free to recommend mods that you want to be in the server and I will classify them for you.<span style="font-weight: bold;"></span></p>

    <h2> <a href="./subpages/vanilla.html">Vanilla+ Mods</a> </h2>
    <p> These are mods that add content which accompany normal Minecraft gameplay.
        They aim to complement Vanilla Minecraft and don't add anything too drastic, and some are just for quality of life.

    <h2> <a href="./subpages/content.html">Content Mods</a> </h2>
    <p> These are mods that add content or modify existing content, and they go beyond Vanilla.
        In comparison to mods above, they add way more content that is particular and unique.
        They introduce new and functional elements to the game that are more drastic
        and some may not necessarily fit the style of Vanilla.

    <h2> <a href="./subpages/client.html">Client + Performance Mods</a> </h2>
    <p> Client mods are basically mods that only apply to your Minecraft client.
        Performance mods are mods that boost your client's performance and they're also technically under Client mods.
